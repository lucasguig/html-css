    <h2><strong>One Great Fractured</strong></h2>
    <p> In one exchange with Hyetta toward the end of her questline she speaks for the Three Fingers and says "all that there is came from the One Great. Then came fractures, and births, and souls. But the Greater Will made a mistake. Torment, despair, affliction... every sin, every curse. Every one, born of the mistake". This seems to be an insinuation for the creation of universe or at least the broader world beyond the Lands Between similar to the Big Bang. The Three Fingers seem to put the blame on the Greater Will for creating the world and splitting apart the One Great, though they are a bit of an unreliable narrator (see Shabriri). In the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC the Greater Will is given a bit more of a description, being a circular celestial body with a lightless abyss (see High Priest Hat).</p>

    <h2>War against the Giants</h2>
    <p>Long ago the forces of Queen Marika went to war against the Fire Giants at the birth of the Erdtree. According to her Spoken Echo she delivered a speech at the First Church of Marika. "Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand. Put the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount. Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life. Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!". Godfrey, First Elden Lord led the war against the Giants, gaining the moniker of Lord of the Battlefield. Many champions took part in the war using Flame Protect Me alongside Trolls, lesser descendants of the Giants, who betrayed their kin and fought for the Erdtree. The knights of Zamor, who were said to have been the mortal enemies of the Fire Giants since time immemorial, were hailed as heroes in the war. The Fire Giants borrowed from the power of a fell god, who was believed to have been slain by Queen Marika (see One-Eyed Shield). The Fire Giants were defeated, leaving only one sole survivor. Upon realizing the flames of their forge would never die, Queen Marika marked him with a curse. "O trifling giant, mayest thou tend thy flame for eternity". Guardians were appointed to watch over this flame, and came to worship it. The flame guardians harbored a secret, that the fell god still lurks within the Fire Giants.</p>

    <h2>Long March of the Tarnished</h2>
    <p>After countless victories such as the War against the Giants, defeating the Storm Lord, and the siege of Castle Morne, the last worthy enemy of Lord Godfrey fell. This foe was a revenger who was a lone surviving champion from a country now vanished and was so determined to continue fighting that he claimed the swords of an entire clan of warriors. And it was then, as the story is told, that the hue of Lord Godfrey's eyes faded as he lost the sight of Grace. According to spoken echoes of Queen Marika, she gives a speech at the Third Church of Marika and at the Church of Pilgrimage. "My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace. With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between. Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die". "Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed. Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring. Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey". Godfrey and his men became the first tarnished, and left the Lands Between by sea (see Rusted Anchor) to wage war. During this long march the Axe of Godfrey was broken in a battle. After the march came to an end, Godfrey divested himself of kingship, and become a ferocious warrior once more. Under the name Hoarah Loux, Godfrey became a badlands chieftain and encouraged his warriors to shed access adornment as he did.</p>
